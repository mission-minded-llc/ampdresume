## Infrastructure

Amp'd Resume is currently hosted on Vercel. The database is hosted by DigitalOcean. Media assets are
hosted on AWS S3.

For local development, no changes are needed for the database references. However, if you want to
test file upload ability, you'll need to set up an S3 bucket and provide the values for S3 settings
in your local `.env`:

```
# AWS S3 bucket for storing user uploaded files.
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=[your publicly-accessible bucket name]
AWS_S3_USER_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[use your key id]
AWS_S3_USER_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[use your secret access key]
```
