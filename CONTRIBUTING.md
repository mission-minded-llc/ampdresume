## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful
and inclusive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (see `.nvmrc` for version)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Quick Start

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mission-minded-llc/ampdresume.git
   cd ampdresume
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Start the development environment**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   npm run init
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Web app: http://localhost:3000
   - Database: localhost:5432 (postgres/postgres)

## Development Setup

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the following:

**Required for basic functionality:**

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string, set by default.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Random secret for NextAuth
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your local development URL, set by default.

**Optional for full features:**

- OAuth provider credentials (Google, LinkedIn)
- Email server configuration
- AWS S3 credentials for file uploads and Terraform setup.
- OpenAI API key for AI features

### Database Setup

The project uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma:generate

# Run migrations
npm run prisma:migrate

# Seed the database
npm run prisma:seed
```

### Local Authentication

For local development without OAuth providers:

1. Use the email `test@ampdresume.com` in the sign-in form
2. Check `./.cypress-temp/magic-link-test_ampdresume_com.txt` for the magic link
3. Open the link to sign in as the test user

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code.
- Keep strict mode enabled in `tsconfig.json`.
- Use proper type annotations.
- Avoid `any` types.
- Use type inference when possible.

### Code Style

- Use Prettier for code formatting.
- Follow ESLint rules.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions.

### File Organization

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                # Next.js App Router pages
â”œâ”€â”€ components/         # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ graphql/            # GraphQL schema and resolvers
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                # Utility libraries
â”œâ”€â”€ types/              # TypeScript type definitions
â””â”€â”€ util/               # Helper functions
```

### Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks.
- Follow the existing naming conventions.
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces.
- Add tests for new components.

### GraphQL Guidelines

- Use Prisma for all database operations.
- Implement proper session ownership verification.
- Follow the existing resolver patterns.
- Add input validation where needed.

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Update snapshots
npm run test:update
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write tests for new features.
- Use descriptive test names.
- Follow the existing test patterns.
- Mock external dependencies.
- Test both success and error cases.

### Cypress E2E Tests

```bash
# Run Cypress tests
npm run cypress:test

# Clean up test data
npm run cypress:cleanup
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code, only merged through Pull Request with passing Continuous
  Integration pipeline.
- `develop` - Integration branch for features, only merged through Pull Request from forks, or
  optional direct via local.
- `feature/*` - Feature branches.
- `fix/*` - Bug fix branches.
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes.

### Release Process

1. Features are developed in feature branches.
2. Feature branches are merged into `develop`.
3. `develop` is merged into `main` for releases.
4. Hotfixes can be merged directly to `main`.
